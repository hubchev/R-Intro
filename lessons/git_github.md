## git and github 
Please have a look at one of the following tutorials:

- [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)
- [git/github guide - a minimal tutorial](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/)
- [Learn Git with Bitbucket Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud)


These sources provide instructions on how to:

- Install Git and get it working smoothly with GitHub, in the shell and in the RStudio IDE.
- Develop a few key workflows that cover your most common tasks.
- Integrate Git and GitHub into your daily work with R and R Markdown.

Moreover, I recommend to watch my *_git and github tutorial** on ILIAS and to have the [*GIT Cheat Sheet*](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) at hand to remember the meaning of the git commands.


## R Markdown

R Markdown provides an authoring framework for data science. You can use a single R Markdown file to both

- save and execute code and
- generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience.

Please have a look at the following tutorials:

- [R Markdown from RStudio](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)
- [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)

## Exercise

- Install Git on your local computer.
- Register a GitHub account.
- Make a repository on GitHub.
- Clone the repository to your local computer.
- Make a local change, save, commit, and push.
